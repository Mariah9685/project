<h1>My Story</h1>
<p>My Character Marsha is an alien with light brown eyes, light purple nose and eyelids, and nice magenta skin. Marsha’s from a planet called Losar. It’s a little like earth but mostly a cold place on her planet but has a nice warm sunset. And all the creatures there are a size bigger on her planet than earth. - She lives in a lively place and in a really loud city, where the weather is mostly cold but has really great summers once in a while. She is both an outgoing and shy person but very curious and always wanting to learn new things.
